# Welcome to xCropProtection

Welcome to the xCropProtection (xCP) documentation. This documentation provides an **introduction** and will walk new users through **how to get started** with the xCropProtection Landscape Model component, including explanations for **sample input files**.

## Background

Chemical Crop Protection is under scientific and public debate. There seems broad concensus that chemical crop protection will have to be more targeted and generally reduced in the future. In this context also well established risk assessment principles and schemes are questioned.  
In context of these developments, today already specific risk assessment and risk management questions come up which require operational instruments to model real-world chemical plant protection and its environmental impact, eg., 

- **Holistic view to risk**, multiple stressors analysis, eg, bee risk assessment (honey bee, wild bees, pollinators, systems-based approach, [EFSA, Bee Guidance](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6607)) 
- Risk Assessment **Recovery Option** ([EFSA, Aquatic Guidance](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3290)) 
- **Environmental Impact Reduction** (EIR), eg, *what if* analysis, assessment and documentation of real-world EIR by new products and digital environmental safety solutions 
- Insect decline causal analysis and **biodiversity enhancement** 
- **Monitoring** (design, insights, transfer of results to other regions and times) 
- Solutions for ***Integrated Pest Management***: improved integration of the use of chemicals and agricultural practices to reduce environmental impact, comparison of pest control options (eg, weed control)
- Specific Protection Goals: identification of driving factors of populations dynamics for targeted chemical risk assessment endpoints and schemes  
- ***Ecosystem Services*** ([Millennium Ecosystem Assessment](https://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx)): improvend quantitative insights into real-world *Ecosystem Services* for more explicit and transparent cost/benefit risk management  

In summary, the work on key topics of the future of pesticide risk assessment and risk management, as well as overarching goals of  sustainable and regenerative agriculture **requires improved operational instruments** which allow to better understand real-world implications.  
The development of xCP component, in the context of a modular landscape modelling approach ([xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md#xlandscape)), is intended to support these developments. 


## Intro

xCropProtection is a **landscape model *component* for simulating applications of plant protection products** (PPPs) on fields within a given landscape. Multiple PPP uses in multiple crops can be simulated, comprising typical PPP spray sequences, eg. as recommended by plant protection services. This includes chemical and alternative plant protection measures.  

The user defines PPP uses in a ***Crop Protection Calender***, including application technology, and mitigation measures for reducing exposure (risk). The approach of using a *Crop Protection Calender* is based on agricultural practice, where pest control measures for a crop are typically planned based on experiance, PPP availability and other factors. Crop protection plans are made eg, by official plant protection advisory services, farmers, or PPP producers. Besides reflecting ag practice, the approach of a CPC also addresses modelling practice in risk assessment which typically focus on a certain indication, conducted over long time periods. Beyond these established uses, alternative CPCs can be used to assess the environmental impact of alternative pest control options, or to design new pest control means against established ones, considered as baselines.  

On each time step (eg, day) and field in a simulation, xCP checks if there are products to apply. If so, exact application details are determined based on model parameterisation (eg, deterministic or by sampling from  from distributions given by the user) and executed.  

xCP is basically built to be used as a **component, integrated into the modular landscape modelling approach [xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md)**. However, xCP can be used in any other environment.   


## Installation

### Option 1: xCropProtection Demo Model
As every component, xCP needs to be operated in a landscape modelling environment. An example landscape model using xCP was built in the [xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md) framework, called **xCropProtectionDemo**.  
A user who just want to explore xCP or only needs the functionality of xCP should clone the repository [xCropProtectionDemo](https://github.com/xlandscape/xCropProtectionDemo/tree/main). Contact Sascha Bub ([sascha.bub@rptu.de](mailto:sascha.bub@rptu.de)) or Thorsten Schad ([thorsten.schad@bayer.com](mailto:thorsten.schad@bayer.com)) for access to the repository. Cloning steps vary based on the application being used, eg. [Sourcetree](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/clone-a-git-repository/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-visual-studio-code/clone-github-repository?tabs=activity-bar).  

After cloning the repository, a user will have everything necessary to start using xCropProtection including sample scenarios and parametrization files.  


### Option 2: add xCropProtection to any Landscape Model
As any other component, xCP is built to be used (together with other components) in the [xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md) framework in order to build a landscape model. 

1. The Landscape Model must first be set up; see the Landscape Model Core's [README](https://github.com/xlandscape/LandscapeModel-Core/blob/master/README.md) for detailed instructions.
2. Create an xCropProtection folder in *\core\components* if it does not already exist.
3. Copy the xCropProtection component from [GitHub](https://github.com/xlandscape/xCropProtectionDemo/tree/main) into the xCropProtection subfolder.
4. The file *mc.xml* contains information about the components that are used in the created [xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md) model. Make use of the xCropProtection component by adding the following lines:

``` xml
<xCropProtection module="components" class="xCropProtection">
    <xCropProtectionFilePath scales="global">
        $(_PROJECT_DIR_)\CropProtection\$(CropProtectionScenario).xml
    </xCropProtectionFilePath>
    <ParametrizationNamespace scales="global">
        urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization
    </ParametrizationNamespace>
    <SimulationStart type="date" scales="global">
        $(SimulationStart)
    </SimulationStart>
    <SimulationEnd type="date" scales="global">
        $(SimulationEnd)
    </SimulationEnd>
    <RandomSeed type="int" scales="global">
        0
    </RandomSeed>
    <OutputApplicationType>
        $(OutputApplicationType)
    </OutputApplicationType>
    <ProductDatabase>
        $(_PROJECT_DIR_)\$(ProductDatabase)
    </ProductDatabase>
    <Fields>
        <FromOutput component="LandscapeScenario" output="FeatureIds"/>
    </Fields>
    <LandUseLandCoverTypes>
        <FromOutput component="LandscapeScenario" output="FeatureTypeIds"/>
    </LandUseLandCoverTypes>
    <FieldGeometries>
        <FromOutput component="LandscapeScenario" output="Geometries"/>
    </FieldGeometries>
</xCropProtection>
```

```

To start xCropProtection using the sample scenario, **drag *template.xrun* onto *__start_\_.bat***. This will start an xCropProtection run using the demo scenario. Output of the model run can be found in the newly created *\run\Rummen-demo-scenario\mcs\\[mc run ID]\store\arr.dat*.

!!! note  
    **SimIDs need to be unique**. xCropProtection will create a folder for each run using the SimID defined in *template.xrun*. The SimID cannot be the same as a folder already contained in the run folder. If you want to run a simulation with the same SimID you need to delete this folder first.


## Viewing and analyzing the output

### HDFView 
[xLandscape](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md) makes use of multidimensional data stores. At present, [HDF](xLandscape/xLandscape-intro.md#multidimensional-data-store) is being used.  

To view the raw output of xCropProtection, open *\run\Rummen-demo-scenario\mcs\\[mc run ID]\store\arr.dat* with a HDF5 file viewer such as [HDFView](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html). Expand the xCropProtection folder.

### Jupyter Notebooks
The ***analysis* folder** contains Jupyter notebooks which can analyze and visualize the output of xCropProtection. *requirements.txt* lists python packages necessary to run the Jupyter notebooks in this folder.

#### *xCP_write_csv.ipynb*
*xCP_write_csv.ipynb* (version 2.0) **writes the contents of *arr.dat* to a csv file**. User parameters:

`xcrop_arrdat_path` : *C:\path\to\arr.dat*

`output_path` : *C:\path\to\output_file.csv*

In the last cell, comment or uncomment any of the following lines to change the columns written to the csv.

``` py
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(application_dates, columns=["ApplicationDates"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(application_dates_day_month, columns=["ApplicationDayMonth"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(applied_features_data, columns=["FeatureID"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame([feature_id_type_dict.get(x) for x in applied_features_data], columns=["FeatureLULC"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(application_rates_data, columns=["ApplicationRates(g/ha)"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(decode_PPP, columns=["AppliedPPP"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(geom_project_area_ha, columns=["AppliedArea(ha)"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(application_rates_data * geom_project_area_ha, columns=["AppliedMass(g)"]))
dfs.append(pandas.DataFrame(drift_reduction_data, columns=["TechnologyDriftReductions"]))
```

#### *xCP_plot_application_rate.ipynb*
*xCP_plot_application_rate.ipynb* (version 2.0) **plots application rates** (as a scatter plot) of all product applications in a user-defined year. User parameters:

`xcrop_arrdat_path` : *C:\path\to\arr.dat*

`year_to_chart` : only display data for this year

#### *xCP_total_loading.ipynb*
*xCP_total_loading.ipynb* (version 2.0) **charts the total loading over time** for a specific field and for all fields. Total loading is calculated by plotting a cumulative sum of mass applied to a field (or all fields). User parameters:

`xcrop_arrdat_path` : *C:\path\to\arr.dat*

`feature_to_chart` : ID of the field to chart. If a field ID is invalid, the notebook will plot the total loading of the first field it reads.

#### *xCP_map_vis.ipynb*
*xCP_map_vis.ipynb* (version 2.0) **visualizes applications on a map** with the ability to advance through time. Please note that while this code was designed to be as general as possible, users should be aware that the map visualization will need code modification and additional input to work with other scenarios. Any new product names and types must be added to ProductTypes.csv. Also, due to limitations of the mapping package it may not be possible to generate visualizations with large datasets or over long periods of time. User parameters:

`data_store_path` : *C:\path\to\arr.dat*

`input_shp_file_path` : *C:\path\to\LULC.shp*

`output_map_html_path` : *C:path\to\output\html_map.html*

`output_map_html_2_path` : *C:\path\to\output\html_map_2.html*

`product_table` : *C:...\xCropProtection\analysis\ProductTypes.csv*. This table defines product names and their type.

## Acknowledgements
The need and the development of the xCP component was initiated by Thorsten Schad (thorsten.schad@bayer.com). It's realisation was only possibly due to the contribution of colleagues listed below and the sponsoring by Bayer AG.
