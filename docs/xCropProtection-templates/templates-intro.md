# Intro
The *Templates* section provides examples for xCP [**Parameterisations**](../reference/glossary.md#parameterisation). *Parameterisation* refers to the actual xCP parameterisation, ie. building PPP use scenarios.  The templates are for learning purposes and can be used as building block for your own parameterisation.   

Note: the parameterisation makes use of XML as a necessary and sufficient representation of the natural complexity of the characteristics of real-world PPP applications in cultivated landscapes. We are fully aware that XML is not the ideal **user interface**. The development of a **graphical user interface (GUI)** is planned.  

The following templates are included in the current version of xCropProtection and are located in the *CropProtection/PPMCalendars* folder:

- Apple-spray-guide
    - Apple-spray-guide.xml: A parameterization of a recommended spray sequence for apples
- Demo-calendars
    - Active-substance-demo.xml: Demonstrates the application of one active substance
    - Active-substance-demo-2.xml: Demonstrates how to set the input scale of an application
    - Active-substance-demo-3.xml: Demonstrates a tank mix with two products (set the output scale to active substance in the user parameters)
    - PPMCalendar-222.xml: Calendar for the demo scenario
    - PPMCalendar-444.xml: Calendar for the demo scenario
- Rummen
    - PPMCalendar-table-1A.xml: Sample spray sequence for apples, type A
    - PPMCalendar-table-1B.xml: Sample spray sequence for apples, type B
    - PPMCalendar-table-2A.xml: Sample spray sequence for apples, type A
    - PPMCalendar-table-2B.xml: Sample spray sequence for apples, type B
- Templates (corresponding to pages in this section)
    - multiple_application_sequences.xml
    - multiple_applications.xml
    - multiple_indications.xml
    - multiple_indications_with_choice.xml
    - simple_scenario.xml
